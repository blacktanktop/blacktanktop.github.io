abstract: Drug-likeness quantification is useful for screening drug candidates. Quantitative estimates of drug-likeness (QED) are commonly used to assess quantitative drug efficacy but are not suitable for screening compounds targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which have recently gained attention. Therefore, we developed a quantitative estimate index for compounds targeting PPIs (QEPPI), specifically for early-stage screening of PPI-targeting compounds. QEPPI is an extension of the QED method for PPI-targeting drugs that models physicochemical properties based on the information available for drugs/compounds, specifically those reported to act on PPIs. FDA-approved drugs and compounds in iPPI-DB, which comprise PPI inhibitors and stabilizers, were evaluated using QEPPI. The results showed that QEPPI is more suitable than QED for early screening of PPI-targeting compounds. QEPPI was also considered an extended concept of the ‘‘Rule-of-Four’’ (RO4), a PPI inhibitor index. We evaluated the discriminatory performance of QEPPI and RO4 for datasets of PPI-target compounds and FDA-approved drugs using F-score and other indices. The F-scores of RO4 and QEPPI were 0.451 and 0.501, respectively. QEPPI showed better performance and enabled quantification of drug-likeness for early-stage PPI drug discovery. Hence, it can be used as an initial filter to efficiently screen PPI-targeting compounds.
