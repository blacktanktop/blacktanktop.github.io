My colleagues and I participated in The Fourth WBA Hackathon on October 6-8, 2018. It was excited!! 
Our team wanted to implement reinforcement learning with evolutionary strategy (ES) algorithms.

　▶ We can learn in a short time.

　▶ We can differentiate ourselves from other teams (contribute from a different perspective).

　▶ Hypothesis that the algorithm is strong in asynchronous integration.

Step 1: Simplify the model and incorporate reinforcement learning.

Step 2: To resemble the structure of a real brain, break up the implementation into modules.

Finally, Our team (Mynet AI) got prize for Excellence. ([The Fourth WBA Hackathon Report](https://wba-initiative.org/en/3401/))
