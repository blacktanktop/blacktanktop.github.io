## Overview

I wrote an article in my personal blog in Japanese introducing SELFIES, a new molecular representation method that I have been interested in recently. In particular, I wrote about the grammar of SELFIES in detail in Japanese (https://blacktanktop.hatenablog.com/entry/2021/08/12/115613), and also I participated in the SELFIES Workshop on August 13, 2021. Some of the participants asked me if there was an English version equivalent to the Japanese explanation I wrote. So I have translated it back into English. so if you are interested in it, please refer to the following.
